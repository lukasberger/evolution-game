# Evolution game simulator

This project implements a simulator of a modified version of the [Evolution](http://www.northstargames.com/products/evolution) game for the CS4500 â€“ Software Development class. It contains both server and client implementations and allows for networked games.

            strategy_player.py: External Player that implements a strategy
        data_definitions.py: Codifies Evolution data definitions
    /test_harnesses/: Test Harnesses, related JSON test files, and other test-related files
    client: Used to execute client.py
    client.py: Implements Evolution Client with Silly Player strategy
    server: Used to execute server.py
    server.py: Launches an Evolution Server.

To run the Server (defaults to 127.0.0.1:45679):
```
./server  
./server --host HOST --port PORT
./server -i HOST -p PORT
```

To run the Client (defaults to 127.0.0.1:45679)
```
./client
./client --host HOST --port PORT
./client -i HOST -p PORT
```

Tests can be run from the base directory if nose is installed with
```
nosetests evolution
```

A test that compares the output of sequential and remote main can be run with
```
nosetests test_main.py
```

Individual test harnesses can be ran from inside of the test_harnesses directory with run_tests.sh:
```
./run_tests.sh x{name} x{name}_tests
```
